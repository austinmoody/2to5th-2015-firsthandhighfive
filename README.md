# First Hand High Five

Submission for the Cerner 2015 2^5.

This is a simple JavaScript game where you "high five" the [First Hand](https://www.firsthandfoundation.org/) logo.  

You get five chances, then your reaction time is averaged.  Your quickest average time is automatically saved to a [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) snapshot, so that you can come back later and see if you can improve your time.  

The code resides in the highfive.js file and should be 32 lines per cloc:

I wasn't including the HTML file in this count... so if that must count I guess this is disqualified :)

It is running here to give it a shot: http://austinmoody.org/firsthandhighfive/
